# keylogger
a simple keylogger written in python but not obfuscated to bypass av detection. it is just for educational puposes only 
# Requirements 
disable antivirus detection but for me just go to windows defender and exclude folder with all your files
# How it works 
just to automate this process of running the python script, i created a batch file that will run this and push the command prompt windows to background for harder detection. 
You can add the batch script to event schedular to run under certain conditions.
